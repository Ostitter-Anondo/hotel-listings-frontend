<p id="description">A simple hotels listing and bookmarking app, this repository contains the frontend, find the link for the backend below. This project was built entirely to act as a proof of skill. The frontend is built on React with TypeScript (I literally learnt ts just for this project, tho I eventually would have because either vite or eslint kinda ruined react js)</p>
